I'm a population and community ecologist who studies the interactions between plants and herbivores, especially insect herbivores. I have a particular fondness for variability and its causes and consequences for ecology, evolution, and sustainability.

Working with others, I run The Herbivory Variability Network (https://herbvar.org/), an international research group with the goal of advancing our understanding of the causes and consequences of variability in plant-herbivore interactions.
